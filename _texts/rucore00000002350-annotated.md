 I am very sorry that I could not attend the meeting of the Alumni Council on April 13th. These happen to be very busy days with me, as I plan to start shortly for overseas service in connection with the Y.M.C.A., my Church having granted me eight months leave of absence.

Director, War Service Bureau.">Silvers</button>:</p>

This is just to thank you for the War Service letters. I came over last May to work under the Y.M.C.A.; but the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon=" | From: "> <a href="">Boche</a> </button> considered my activites too dangerous, and decided to shoot up <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon=" | From: "> <a href="">the town</a> </button> where my hut was located. They demolished the hut and incidentally sent a chunk of high explosive through my right leg. The result has been that I have spent the summer of 1918 on the flat of my back with the aforesaid leg hung up in a complicated apparatus which has kept my right toe pointing at the North star for three months.

<button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon=" | From: "> <a href="">But it is not as bad as it sounds,</a> </button> and on the whole it has not been a bad summer. Uncle Sam's Army Hospitals are great institutions, and the best that medical science and surgical skill can offer is yours to command. Also it is cheap. I have saved at least $10000. in surgeon's fees by coming over to

 to France to be shot up. So you see I am considerably ahead of the game.

Some day soon or late <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon=" | From: "> <a href="">I expect to get back to the States</a> </button>, and with a right leg adequate at last to the ancient and honerable game of golf. I am afraid, however, I have lost my drive.

It begins to look as if America had sent a real army overseas. Well, it has been on of the big privileges of my life to have some association with it, short as it was. It has been worth coming over, despite my contact with a ten inch shell.

Keep on with the letters. I shall be in the hospital some time yet.

Your letter of September 18 was very welcome. Here at the college we have been worrying about you and our only word has come indirectly. We are glad to know that your injured limb is in the process of healing and we trust that you will not have to spend very much more time in the hospital.

There must be a lot of satisfaction to you in the thought that you have served so bravely and courageously in the big cause in which you are enlisted.
